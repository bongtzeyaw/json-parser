# json-parser
A Haskell project to implement a json parser without using third party libraries such as Parsec. The parsing technique used is known as Parser combinator. This is a project that gives us insights as to why a lot of compilers and parsers are implemented in Haskell.

# Quick Test
```console
$ runghc -Wall -Werror Main.hs
```
